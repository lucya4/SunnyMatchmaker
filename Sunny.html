    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Sunny Matchmaker capitalizes on the development of LLMs to revolutionize
      the way people find relationships online. The possibility for conversation,
       analyzing intangible qualities through users’ speech, and gaining the
       trust of the user through personal interaction was a luxury only highly
        paid dating coaches had access to in the dating industry. Now, LLMs
         offer the possibility of an affordable dating coach at scale that can
          improve matching and user experience on dating apps in general.

    <p>Sunny Matchmaker is a dating app that provides recommendations on par with that of a trusted friend or a paid dating coach, at the cost, scale, and continual availability of a dating app. Unlike traditional dating apps, it is personalized, tailored to the user, and assists the user in finding potential matches by using conversation analysis to answer questions such as:  Would a potential match tend to converse and interact in a compatible way? Are their levels of energy, styles of movement, speeds of conversation, inflection, levels of formality, compatible? There are countless intangible cues that provide clues as to the potential compatibility of partners.
      Sunny Matchmaker uses an LLM based companion to manage interaction between the user and the app. From the moment it is first opened, the user is greeted by their matchmaker, and engages in an unstructured, informal conversation that helps the user and matchmaker get to know one another. Once a basic user profile is set up, Sunny Matchmaker collects background information from the user about their goals on the app, what they look for in a partner, etc.
      All users get access to a wall of users in their area that they are free to chat with, and paid subscribers receive a recommended “match” with a natural language explanation for the match on each login, up to one per day. Sunny Matchmaker uses data from user interaction on the app as well as direct feedback from the user about matches to improve matching success over time.

      About 50% of all dating app users report their experiences on dating platforms to be negative (Vogels and McClain) largely due to distrust in the app’s ability to find quality matches (Battle). The dating apps on the market have shallow, limited, evidence about the compatibility of potential matches they nominate to the user. These matches are often generated based on a small list of shared interests that have little to do with true personal compatibility. Although looks are superficially accounted for on these apps, a survey conducted by BBC found that almost 90% of people prefer personal qualities over superficial when it comes to dating (Park). Because this preference is unaccounted for on most traditional dating apps, the matching success rate is likely reduced. People are tired of swiping, playing a virtual game of roulette, and hoping that out of the ten random profiles they see, one will be a match.

      But what if potential matches were made by someone who knows the user’s personality? Of all partnered adults in the US, across all age groups, more people met through friends and family (32%) than through any other means (Mitchell & Mitchell, 2024b). Why? Because friends and family are familiar with countless intangible qualities of a person: Their pacing and style of conversation, old tales about ex-partners, etc., and they have seen some of that person’s experiences in the dating world first hand, making them ideal for choosing a potential match. This familiarity has been impossible to replicate within an dating app… until now.
